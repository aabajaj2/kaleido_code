>`generate_uid.py` generates unique id for a given integer following these rules:
* Minimum of 4 characters up to a maximum of 6 characters in length
* All letters should be uppercase.
* The first character must be a letter, but not a vowel.
* the remaining characters can be letters or numbers.
* For one run of the program, each integer is mapped to unique value, for testing more integers, we can modify the `test` array
